# General Notes

- Adhere to Retend JSX rules.
- Don't use React APIs or architecture.
- Don't make mistakes.
- Don't make assumptions.
- Document all functions and components extensively with JSDoc.
- Named functions at the top module level. Use arrow functions otherwise.
- Addendum to the above: Use named functions for event handlers. Access their target as `this`.
- Components and functions are no more than 50 lines of code.
- When generating multiple files, annotate the top of each file with the path to the file.
